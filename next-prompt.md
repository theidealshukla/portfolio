Harmonize the brand identity across all pages. Currently, the site uses different names ("Visionary", "DEV.LAB", "Z_PORTFOLIO", "PORTFOLIO.", "alex.studio", "Visual Archive").

Task:
1. Choose a single brand name (e.g., "Visionary" or the user's name if known, otherwise stick to "Visionary" or "DEV.LAB").
2. Update the logo/brand text in the navigation bar of `index.html`, `project.html`, `gallery.html`, `services.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html` to be consistent.
3. Ensure the footer copyright text and links are also consistent.
4. Verify all internal links are correct and point to the right pages (`index.html`, `project.html`, `gallery.html`, `services.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`).
