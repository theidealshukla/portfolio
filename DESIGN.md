# Design System: Portfolio 2024
**Project ID:** 7625739203642237417

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
The design language is "Cinematic Digital Noir." It features a deep, immersive dark mode that serves as a canvas for vibrant, neon-purple accents. The aesthetic is modern, tech-forward, and artistic, utilizing high-contrast elements and spacious layouts to create a sense of sophistication and drama. The vibe is "Visionary," "Immersive," and "Bold."

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
*   **Void Black (#000000/Dark Backgrounds):** Used for the primary background to create depth and contrast.
*   **Electric Violet (#7b25f4):** The primary brand color, used for key actions, highlights, and accents to draw attention.
*   **Starlight White (#FFFFFF):** Used for primary text and headings to ensure maximum readability against the dark background.
*   **Muted Steel (#9CA3AF):** Used for secondary text and subtle borders.

## 3. Typography Rules
*   **Primary Font:** **Space Grotesk**. A geometric sans-serif that conveys a modern, technical feel.
*   **Headings:** Bold, uppercase, and large-scale (e.g., `text-6xl`, `font-bold`) to make a statement.
*   **Body:** Clean and legible, often with slightly increased letter spacing for a premium feel.

## 4. Component Stylings
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **Primary:** Solid Electric Violet background, pill-shaped or slightly rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), white text, hover effects that increase brightness or add a glow.
    *   **Secondary:** Transparent background with a thin white or violet border, hover fill effects.
*   **Cards/Containers:**
    *   Dark, slightly elevated surfaces (e.g., `bg-white/5` or `bg-gray-900`), with subtle borders (`border-white/10`) and soft, diffused shadows.
    *   **Roundness:** "Round Eight" implies typically `rounded-lg` or `rounded-2xl` depending on element size.
*   **Inputs/Forms:**
    *   Minimalist, with transparent backgrounds and bottom or full borders in Muted Steel or Electric Violet. Focus states utilize the primary color.

## 5. Layout Principles
*   **Spacing:** Generous whitespace (padding and margins) to create a breathable, gallery-like experience.
*   **Grid:** Bento-style grids for showcasing projects and services, allowing for flexible and dynamic content presentation.
*   **Alignment:** Key text elements often centered or aligned to a strong grid for structure.
